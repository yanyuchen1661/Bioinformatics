[Cell-type differential DNA methylation test](DMCs_AD/README.md)

## Second-generation sequencing
- What?
  - Also known as High-throughtput sequencing and Next generation sequencing (NGS)
- Why?
  - Strength
    - Cheap
    - short read length
    - Quick
  - Application
    - greater dynamic range
    - Higher signal-to-noise ratios
    | Technology | Description |
