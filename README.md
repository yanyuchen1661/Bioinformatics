# Bioinformatics

## Project
[Cell-type differential DNA methylation test](DMCs_AD/README.md)

## Second-generation sequencing

- What?
  - Also known as High-throughtput sequencing and Next generation sequencing (NGS)
- Why?
  - Strength
    - Cheap
    - short read length
    - Quick
  - Application
    - greater dynamic range
    - Higher signal-to-noise ratios
    | Technology | Description |
    | --- | ---|
    | DNA-Seq | sequence genomic DNA |
    | RNA-Seq | sequence RNA products |
    | CHIP-Seq | detect protein-DNA interaction sites |
    | Bisulfite | measure DNA methylation strengths |
