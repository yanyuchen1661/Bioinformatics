# Bioinformatics

## Project
[Cell-type differential DNA methylation test](DMCs_AD/README.md)

## Second-generation sequencing

- What?
  - Also known as High-throughtput sequencing and Next generation sequencing (NGS)
- Why?
  - Strength
    - Cheap
    - short read length
    - Quick
  - Application
    - greater dynamic range
    - Higher signal-to-noise ratios
    | Technology | Description |
    | --- | ---|
    | DNA-Seq | sequence genomic DNA |
    | RNA-Seq | sequence RNA products |
    | CHIP-Seq | detect protein-DNA interaction sites |
    | Bisulfite | measure DNA methylation strengths |
    
### Perform

- Illumina: HiSeq, Miseq
- LifeTech: SOLiD, IonTorrent
- Roche 454

### Process

<math>
    f(k; r, p) \equiv \Pr(X = k) = \binom{k+r-1}{k} (1-p)^r p^k
  </math>
